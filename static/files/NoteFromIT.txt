Reminder for how to access the company FTP Server, for super secure documents:

1. Connect to the company wifi network (reminder: this wifi network is not connected the internet, it just hosts the secure documents!)
2. Connect to the ftp server, or go to 'ftp://192.168.0.1' in your browser
3. Enter your doctor credentials!
4. You're in!

Call me if you have any questions!
